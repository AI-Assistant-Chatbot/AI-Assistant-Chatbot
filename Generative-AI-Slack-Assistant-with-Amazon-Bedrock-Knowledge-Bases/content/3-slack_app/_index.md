A Slack app is a tool or integration that extends the functionality of Slack: it adds new features, automates tasks, integrates with external services, or enhances the user experience. A Slack app allows you to do more within Slack than just chat. With the Slack platform, individual and enterprise developers alike can create apps that integrate directly with the tools teams already use, whether that's connecting a CRM, managing project boards, or sending automated alerts.

We know our platform is deep and wide, and possibly a little intimidating as a result. It's okay to not know where to start.

- If you want to take it slow, this guide on designing your app is a little light reading on how to define the look and feel of your app.

- If you'd rather stop the chitchat and get into it, build an app with the Quickstart guide. If you're just looking to get a token to call the Web API methods, completing the first three steps of the Quickstart will get you there.
