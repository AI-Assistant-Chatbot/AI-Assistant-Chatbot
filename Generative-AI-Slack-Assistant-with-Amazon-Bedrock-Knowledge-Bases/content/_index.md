# Building a Generative AI Slackbot Assistant with Amazon Bedrock

#### Quick Summary

Build a production-ready Slack bot powered by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that intelligently answers questions about your organization's documents using advanced AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**What you'll create:**

- AI-powered Slack bot with `/ask-aws` commands
- Enterprise-grade RAG system using Amazon Bedrock
- Secure content filtering with Bedrock Guardrails
- Scalable serverless architecture on AWS

#### Duration

**Total Workshop Time:** 3-4 hours
